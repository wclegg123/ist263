Current Major: Data Science â€“ im interested in learning about data bases and different aspects of data analytics and using programs to make different interpretations of data 

I'm on an ROTC Scholarship and this past summer I graduated from the Army Air Assault and Rappel Master Schools.  

I like to work out a lot and make food, hang out with friends, or mix all of the above.
