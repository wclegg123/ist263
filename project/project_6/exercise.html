                    <h3>Text area talking about my history with lifting and how I got to where I am today with it becoming one of my main interests and developing a routine</h3>
                    <p>My journey with weight training began during my sophomore year of high school. Initially, I was intimidated by the weight room and uncertain about proper form and programming. I started with basic bodyweight exercises and light dumbbells, gradually building confidence and knowledge.</p>
                    <p>The turning point came when I committed to learning proper technique and following a structured program. I spent hours researching training methodologies, watching form videos, and seeking advice from experienced lifters. This dedication to education paid off as I began seeing consistent progress in both strength and physique.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, lifting has evolved from a casual activity into one of my primary passions. I've experimented with various training styles—powerlifting, bodybuilding, CrossFit-inspired workouts—and extracted the elements that work best for my goals and lifestyle.</p>

                    <h3>Text area talking about my history with lifting and how I got to where I am today with it becoming one of my main interests and developing a routine (CONT)</h3>
                    <p>One of the most significant milestones in my lifting journey was when I finally achieved my goal of a 225-pound bench press, a 315-pound squat, and a 405-pound deadlift. These weren't just numbers—they represented years of dedication, proper programming, and consistent effort.</p>
                    <p>I've learned that progress isn't always linear. There have been plateaus, setbacks, and even minor injuries along the way. Each challenge taught me something valuable about patience, recovery, and the importance of listening to your body.</p>
                    <p>The community aspect of lifting has also been invaluable. Training partners who push you, experienced lifters who share their knowledge, and even the friendly competition in the gym—all of these elements have contributed to my growth.</p>
                    <p>Looking forward, I'm excited to continue refining my technique, exploring new training methodologies, and setting increasingly ambitious goals. Lifting will always be a cornerstone of my fitness journey.</p>
