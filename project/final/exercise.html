                        <p>I believe that pull ups are the epitome of physical fitness. The strength to overcome your own body weight demonstrates complete control over your body and determination to become greater. Adding weight to this already universily difficult movement demonstrates dedication, strength, and power. Adding weight to pull ups has greatly helped me grow my back and arms, and has metrically brought my body weight performance up</p>

                        <h3>🏋️ Dips/Weighted Dips</h3>
                        <p>Weighted Dips follow the same pattern of showing control by being stronger than your body weight. Dips, while theoretically difficult, are generally an easier motion than pull ups. Adding weight is necessary for me to be efficient with my workouts, as without it I can complete an upwards of 60 reps which is less productive and more time consuming than a smaller and heavier set </p>

                    <h3>My lifting history</h3>
                    <p>Weight lifting is still relatively new to me. I have really only been in the gym consistently for about a year and a half, starting in the second semester of my freshman year at college. This doesn't mean I wasn't heavily into fitness and building muscle, however. Back in middle school I was far shorter and generally smaller than almost all of my peers. I played football and wrestled and knew that I would need to get stronger to keep up. I began doing pushups in my room every night before bed. While this isn't a very unique growing boy story, I would say it was more unique in the fact that I kept up with it for several years, up until my sophomore year of high school.</p>
                    <p>It was around this time I started growing and putting on more weight, moving up from the 106lb weight class that I wrestled in freshman year, to the 130, 140, and 150 pound weight classes the following years. While this was happening, one of my coaches suggested I start training pull ups for strength, so I bought a doorframe pull up bar and became heavily invested in doing as many in a row as I could. I began rotating between pull ups and push ups, developing an early look at what would later become my routine.</p>
                    <p>Come junior year, all of my friends urged me to join the crew team with them, which I did. This sport was heavily transformational for me in the way that I would train my legs, as they were the most important part of the rowing stroke and critical to power on the water, and how I trained cardio. Cardio had always come to me naturally from my other sports and regular exercise, but that wasn't enough for crew. I began other workouts like the bike and row ergometers, doing jump squats, and other brutal calisthenic leg workouts. Learning the importance of these aspects of training helped keep my workouts and routine well rounded.</p>
                    <p>By the end of high school, I developed a calisthenic routine that followed the same format as the routine I follow today in the gym. Calisthenic strength is very impressive, important, and will always have a place in my heart for this reason, but the efficiency of free weights and machine workouts is too great to be ignored. As I became more invested in the gym rather than my at home workouts, I began valuing bulking and gaining more weight in order to lift more and build my physique. Over the course of the next year of studying different diets, looking at what different influencers have to say, and lots of personal experimenting, I developed my eating routine that would keep me constantly gaining weight while staying relatively lean.</p>
                    <p>I have important physical expectations and goals for myself and from the Army as a contracted ROTC Cadet. I use aspects of the different workouts over the years mixed together as my daily routine, and I am very pleased with the results that have come from my consistency with it in the last year. </p>                </div>
