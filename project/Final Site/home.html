                <h3>Welcome! My name is William Clegg, and this is my page for showing parts of my routine that have played a key role in achieving my fitness goals. I am highly enthusiastic about exercise and trying new things, so over the years I have experimented with many different types of training and dieting, so I wanted to create a site that I could use to highlight the methods that have worked the best for me so far.</h3>

                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <h3>I am a student and Cadet at Syracuse University. I am pursuing a degree in Data Science through the Syracuse School of Information, and a commision after graduation at which point I will become a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Army. Over the past few years, I have become heavily focused on weight lifting, creating routines for eating habits and exercise, and creating a strong physique. I beleive that as a future officer, these are necessary aspects of your life to have in check and be fully developed by the time I am given a leadership role over other soldiers</h3>
